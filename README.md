PolarAreaChart
==============

An iPad app that creates and displays a polar area chart using Core Graphics.
The data for the chart is fetched from a JSON File stored on a remote server. 
The chart uses values that are normalized based on the largest value present in the json file (radius of largest value slice = radius of chart), so the scale is dynamic.
